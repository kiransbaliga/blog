Data Structures and Algorithms is one of the most important concept that you should be thorough with no matter which language you code.

Every interviewer will ask you questions on the same.
From Competitive Coding to Software development.. You are going to stumble upon Data Structures. 

And I noticed lot of my classmates including myself was weak in DSA. Hence this blog to **learn DSA by spending not more than 20 mins per day**

I tried various websites to practise coding problems and I found <span style="color:blue">[leetcode](https://leetcode.com) </span> was very convinient and best for this purpose.

Before you start getting right into it make sure your basic concepts are clear. Refer various youtube videos and other blogs clear these basic concepts

> LeetCode

<span style="color:blue">[leetcode](https://leetcode.com) </span> offers daily challenges which we will be solving and discussing the concepts about the challenges.

So lets start!
