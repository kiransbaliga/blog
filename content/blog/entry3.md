Before we begin, Let's start with definitions and applications of Machine learning.

> ## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the idea of a machine or a computer doing a task without being programmed to do so, But instead, it learns and adapts to improve itself.
In this process, with the help of datasets, a machine is able to find patterns and predict outcomes with considerable accuracy as we train the machine learning model.

>## What are its Applications?

The applications are basically limitless, but here are some ML models that you use in your daily life:-
- Google Search Engine: The recommendation that pops when you type a single character is the result of immense training of ML models for the convenience  for us users So that we are able to search and access results almost instantly
- Recommendation Systems like in Netflix:  We like to Netflix and chill, but ever wondered how they recommend movies to you? Yes, it's Machine learning!
- Image Recognition
- Email Spam and Malware filtering! and much more...


>## How to Get Started?
To get started with Machine learning basic programming knowledge is required.
If you don't have experiences don't worry! It's not that hard and you can start anytime!
Here are the basic requirements:-

- Basic Python programming skills : You can start learning python [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-python-from-zero-to-hero-120ea540b567/)
- Python basics on NumPy, pandas and matplotlib modules.

> Numpy

- NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. You can learn the basics of NumPy [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_getting_started.asp).

> Pandas

- Pandas is a python module for data analysis and manipulation. Learn the basics of Pandas[here.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_getting_started.asp).

> MatPlotLib

- matplotlib is a python module for visualizing the data. Learn basics of matplotlib [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp)

> Jupyter

Now that we are all set up and we are ready to start.
first, we need to install the required modules in python for ML.
installing Jupyter notebook :-

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and
Share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text
        
```
python -m pip install jupyterlab
```
```
python -m pip install notebook
```  

> Installing Sci-Kit Learn

Scikitlearn is a python module that contains various complex machine learning algorithms.
to install just write the following command in the command line:-

```
python -m pip install scikit-learn
```

and that's it! Just wait for some moment and installation will be done!

Learn to build your first machine learning model here:-
download Jupyter notebook from the following link

Learn more on machine learning by following free courses:-
- [Introduction to machine learning (Stanford)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
- [Deep learning specialization (Deeplearning.ai - Andrew Ng)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w/playlists)

You can also refer to various books that are available for free and paid.
I personally prefer Books because it helps you learn from the core. Here are some awesome ML books that I prefer:

1. [Hands on Machine Learning.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
2. [Python data science handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

And that's it! always keep learning, Watch online videos as much as you can. Try to do small projects based on what you have learnt.
